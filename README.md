For my wedding in 2011 I wanted to write a rich web page to allow guests to RSVP, reserve rooms at the venue, PAY for those rooms, sign up for events (like horseback riding, canoeing, etc), sigh up for carpools, etc.

For this I had to learn PHP, MySQL, Javascript in the browser (I had previous JS experience but in a different environment), jQuery, AJAX methods, CSS, and the PayPalAPI.

Some of the php for the pages came with the template, but all of the interaction, outside of the navbar, was written entirely by me.
