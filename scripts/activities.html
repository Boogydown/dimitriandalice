		<h4>Kayak/canoe</h4>
		Moon River is nestled in a horseshoe of the Brazos River.  The river is calm but beautiful.  Canoeing down the Brazos you'll see some sandy beaches, tall trees, neat wildlife, and other quirks of one of the US's only salt-water rivers.<br/>
		The trip covers about 3 miles and takes about 1.5 hours.  There are enough canoes and kayaks to cover about 15 people, and we'll do 3 trips.<br/>

		<h4>Horseback Riding</h4>
		For a more land-based tour of Moon River, Gloria and her team of horses will take you around the orchard, the pastures, and by the river.<br/>
		The trip takes about 40 minutes and she can take 8 at a time.  She can also tailor the lesson/ride depending on experience, so when you sign up, please do so according to your experience level and we'll group you accordingly. <br/>
		<li>Number of slots remaining:<b><span id="horseRemain"></span></b>.<br/></li>

		<h4>Skeet Shooting</h4>
		Another taste of life on the ranch is learning how to shoot.  Skeet shooting is available for those who would be interested.<br/>
		This is the only activity that you will have to pay for.  It is $100/hr, and sign-up is for 15-minute increments.  They provide a 20 gauge, 870 Wingmaster (or you can bring your own), and ammunition is $10 per box of shells.<br/>
		Please bring cash.

		<hr/>
		<h4>Hay Ride</h4>
		For those with younger kiddos, the Hay Ride is also a fun option.  Throw some hay bales on a trailor, pull it with a tractor through the orchard and back pasture, and you've got yourselves some easy entertainment!<br/>
		The Hay Ride will run every hour and can fit about 10 people each time.<br/>
